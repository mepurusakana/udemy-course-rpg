  - "The year is 1815.                                         \r\n\r\n              
    The French revolution is a distant                        \r\n              
    memory. Napoleon has been defeated.                       \r\n              
    France is ruled by a King again.  "
  - "  RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething         \r\n    
    in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air.         \r\n    
    Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest        \r\n    
    of tall masted warships. \r\n"
  - "The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their            \r\n    
    rigging.                                                            \r\n\r\n    
    Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships             \r\n    
    under construction, and warships being refitted. "
